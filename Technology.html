        <h1>Technology</h1>
         ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; 
        and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in 
        the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as 
        scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the
         like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of 
         their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it 
         according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology 
         systems or technological systems.
        The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric 
        discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available 
        sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their 
        environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and 
        the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact 
        freely on a global scale.
Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy)
and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known
as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always
influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include 
the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.
Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology 
improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary
 movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates
  people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological
   progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

    <h3>Technicism</h3>
Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.[56] Taken to 
an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems 
with the use of scientific–technological methods and tools."In other words, human beings will someday be able 
to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma, 
connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority.

<h3>Optimism</h3>
See also: Extropianism and Technological optimism
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism, which
view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition.
In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.

Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly
refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed.

Singularitarians believe in some sort of "accelerating change";that the rate of technological progress accelerates
as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a "Singularity" after artificial general intelligence
is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary,
but prominent futurist Ray Kurzweil estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045.

Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life 
epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the 
universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of
speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant
Singularity event.

Some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno-utopianism and fear the notion of human 
enhancement and technological singularity which they support. Some have described Karl Marx as a techno-optimist.

    <h3>Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century</h3>
This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries.

The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face.
What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem?

— Bernstein, Jared, "It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down: It’s the Weak Economy, Among Other Things,"
 in The American Prospect, October 2014
In his article, Jared Bernstein, a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,questions the widespread
 idea that automation, and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing labor market
  problem. His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral 
  approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning unemployment and declining wages.

He uses two main arguments to defend his point. First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number
 of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced
  so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, automation threatens repetitive jobs
   but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that "requires flexibility
    judgment and common sense"[70] remain hard to replace with machines. Second, studies have not shown clear links
     between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.

Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American
 increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about "bad policy that fails to offset the 
 imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity."

For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience
fatigue and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns. Continuous studies have shown 
that increased BMI and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising 
frequently.Heavy Internet use is also displayed in the school lower grades of those who use it in excessive 
amounts.It has also been noted that the use of mobile phones whilst driving has increased the occurrence of road 
accidents — particularly amongst teen drivers. Statistically, teens reportedly have fourfold the number of road
traffic incidents as those who are 20 years or older, and a very high percentage of adolescents write (81%) and
read (92%) texts while driving.In this context, mass media and technology have a negative impact on people,
 on both their mental and physical health.

<h3>Technological systems</h3>
Thomas P. Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be
aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.What is the difference between a wheel
or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them,
or none of them as technologies?
Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process involving human
ingenuity".This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking
"technologies," but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use
of complex technological systems.
Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that
engineers, scientists, and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they 
want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly 
questioned.For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: "Internet-centrism" and "solutionism." 
Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and 
coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially
thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to Alexis
Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to "unexpected consequences that could eventually 
cause more damage than the problems they seek to address."Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed 
the multivalent effects of technology.

Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed – 
especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and
argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists 
and engineers’ new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science "[require] technical
professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators
in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions.
